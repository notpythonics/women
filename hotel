I was at a hotel with a group on a high floor, and there was a monster or monsters, as I recall, that we killed. Then I entered the elevator alone to go down.
When I got off, I saw construction workers building the hotel.
I greeted one of them, and then a girl came down, and we lay on our stomachs on a red container, talking. The place was surrounded by iron fences.

She said: "This place used to have a circular lake."
I replied: "Yes."

The conversation went on, and I felt at ease. The dream was blurry, but the girl was definitely beautiful, and her voice was lovely too.
I left and passed the fences, where there was a door made of stone or iron. I looked at the red container and saw the girl talking to another girl. My heart felt calm and relaxed as I watched them. Their legs were raised.

The dream ended.
