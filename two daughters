My narration of the dream isn't complete because the dream was blurry, and I forgot some details upon waking up.

I dreamed that I had two daughters, and we went on a trip. The younger daughter was remarkably intelligent and well-mannered, like a perfect fairy.
She saved me when I was trapped in a basement by killing them. We returned home in a truck, and while I was driving, there were people with yellow skin, like cartoon characters.
As I drove the bus forward, they ducked to avoid hitting it.

There was a conversation between the younger and older daughters about me.
The older one said, "Did you kill him? Why did you do that? Isn't that strange..."
The conversation seemed strange and mysterious, as if the older daughter was trying to spark hostility between me and her sister.

We arrived home, and I called my younger daughter. My older daughter was sitting next to me on the right side, while the little fairy stood at the door leaning against it.
My older daughter and I started thinking about what to buy for her, while she watched us quietly and curiously.

During the dream, I felt at ease, and my heart was bright, as if I were in paradise.
